# dogArrangements
dogArrangements(nPassive, nAggressive), which calculates the number of ways to arrange aggressive and passive dogs such that aggressive dogs are placed between passive ones. It uses factorials to calculate permutations of both types of dogs and combinations to place aggressive dogs in available slots. Main() tests the solution against sample cases.
